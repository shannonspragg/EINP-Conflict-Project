# EINP-Conflict-Project
This is a repository for the conflict and connectivity analysis of Elk Island National Park for black bears, wolves, and cougar.

##################
The following scripts include the steps for compiling conflict report data, producing habitat suitability models, creating connectivity resistance surfaces, running connectivity models, and validating model results.

########################### Black Bear Analysis ######################################################
This folder contains the different sets of scripts to produce the habitat suitability model for bears, the connectivity models for bears, and the conflict report models for bears. To replicate this analysis, complete the scripts in the following order:

1. b bear habitat data scripts -- complete the numbered scripts to download and prep habitat data variables

2. b bear habitat model scripts -- complete this series of scripts to replicate the habitat suitability model for black bears

3. b bear connectivity scripts -- follow these scripts to produce the resistance surface inputs for running biophysical and social connecitivity models in Omniscape (external)

4. b bear conflict analysis scripts -- complete this series of scripts to prep the conflict report data, variables, and general and bear conflict model analyses
